# Darkwraith Covenant 
is the open source multimedia music, art, video, and programming project of Jose De Lara (he/him) of Portland, OR. Jose previously played guitar and sang in the post punk band Protokoll. Darkwraith Covenant was formed in 2013, but went dormant for several years while Jose played guitar and bass in the Outsider Hardcore band, Drunk Dad (Portland, OR). In 2021, DWC began to re-emerge, but as a satirically evil faux corporation under the name Darkwraith Covenant Industries Inc.

Darkwraith Covenant is an instinctive foray into loud, nasty, synthesized industrial dance music. He is sometimes joined by Kevin No on auxillary percussion and drums.

Lyrically, Darkwraith Covenant unflinchingly covers anti-authoritarianism, parasitic corporatism, femme subjugation, and wage slavery, among other politically charged subjects.

Jose is currently learning React, Javascript, Web Design, and Full Stack Development.
He is skilled in IT Infrastructure maintenance, Powershell Automation, Network Administration, and Desktop/Server Applications. He is currently employed as an IT Specialist at a local non-profit that helps houseless youth off the streets and into housing, education, healthcare and employment.
