# Darkwraith Covenant 
is name of the multimedia music, art, video, and programming project of Jose De Lara (he/him) of Portland, OR. Darkwraith Covenant was formed in 2013, but went dormant for several years while Jose played guitar in the Outsider Hardcore band, Drunk Dad (Portland, OR). In 2021, DWC began to re-emerge, but as a satirical faux corporation under the name Darkwraith Covenant Industries Inc. All official satirical communication is written with three 🗡️ emoji as tags to indicate it is a satirical post. 

Darkwraith Covenant is an instinctive foray into loud, nasty, synthesized industrial dance music. He is sometimes joined by Kevin No on auxillary percussion and drums.

Lyrically, Darkwraith Covenant unflinchingly covers anti-authoritarianism, parasitic corporatism, femme subjugation, and wage slavery, among other politically charged subjects.

Jose is currently learning React, Javascript, Web Design, and Full Stack Development.
He is skilled in IT Infrastructure maintenance, Powershell Automation, Network Administration, and Desktop/Server Applications. He is currently employed as an IT Specialist at a local non-profit that helps houseless youth off the streets and into housing, education, healthcare and employment.
